# Emma Bradford Initial Self-Assessment

I decided to do this to be read list generator because I was tinkering with the idea over the summer. This was the perfect excuse to build something that I was thinking about building already. I have a passion for books and reading. So this works really well with my interests. Going into creating a website, I had a very little experience. My last coop was a web development Co-op, but a lot of what I was doing was very specific to the coop I was working. During the coop,  I'm mainly focused on the back end. This is why I am choosing which to work on the back end. I believe the backedn end is harder to learn. The front end easier to learn. I was also managing the database. I learned a lot over the course of this semester. One of the things I've learned is that creating a website from scratch is a lot harder than it seems. Even working on building basic CRUD operations is harder than expected. Each API built for a website is specific to that website. I could reference a little bit what I had built in the past, but I largely had to build everything from scratch. It was a lot more time-consuming than I had expected. Unfortunately I have not been able to get everything that I wanted done this semester. That's why Nolan and I designed our senior design project so we're building a lot of the foundation for this semester. Next semester we have time to work out all the kinks in the code.
