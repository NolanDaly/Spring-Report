## Justification
 * Emma
    - I created and maintained a database of books that is over six hundred books long. I converted that spreadsheet into Json data. Manually entered all data from that spreadsheet into the mongodb database. I created all of the backend endpoints.   there are three categories of back indent points. The first category is the book and points so this includes update, delete, get by ID, get all, and post for the book module. The next category is the genre. I created a get all unique genres back endpoint that will return the unique genres in the database. I also created the end point that gives the user book recommendations based on the input fields from the front end.
