# Nolan Daly Final Self-Assessment

For my groupâ€™s senior design project, the work was split between the two of us, with me handling the front-end of our web application. This required me to learn the fundamentals of UI; design a functional front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and learn how to use React and Node.js for the purposes of communicating with the backend. While I was not able to do quite as much as I had initially hoped last Fall, I used a variety of tutorials and test projects to learn the fundamentals of web development, which is a substantial step forward from having no experience. More specifically, I am now able to better understand the structure of a web application and the languages necessary to create it, which allowed me to create a rudimentary front-end for the project. Despite this progress, my lack of experience was a major setback. While I certainly learned quite a bit, it came at the cost of devoting less time to developing the web application. As a result, my final work was unpolished, and definitely could have used more time to implement additional features.
