#Project Description

Our project is focused on creating a web-based application that is capable of generating a list of books to read based on user criteria. The application will be split into two parts: a front-end for user interaction, and a back-end for processing queries and interacting with our database. The front-end will allow the user to specify criteria, which will be used by the back-end to generate a list.
