# Project Description

Our project is focused on creating a web-based application that is capable of generating a list of books to read based on user criteria. The application will be split into two parts: a front-end for user interaction, and a back-end for processing queries and interacting with our database. The front-end will allow the user to specify criteria, which will be used by the back-end to generate a list.

After testing a variety of platforms, the best choices for our front-end and back-end were determined to be React/Node.js and MongoDB, respectively. These options were the easiest to use for a simplistic project like ours, and were fairly straightforward to learn. Despite their relative simplicity, they have more than enough features to enable us to complete our project.

Generally, as two computer science students, we have taken more than enough courses on the topic to be capable of handling this subject. In particular, our mandatory courses on subjects such as data structures and databases have proven to be useful, given our projectâ€™s reliance on these fields of computer science.

We will be splitting development on our project between the two of us, with one member focusing primarily on the front-end of development, and the other on the back-end. This is mostly a result of our prior experience with certain aspects of development, as Emma is significantly more familiar with creating/interacting with databases than Nolan. Other areas of our project, such as formal writing and assignments, will be as evenly split between both members as is possible.
