# User Interface Specifications

## UI Example

![Front-end design](https://github.com/NolanDaly/Spring-Report/blob/main/Documents/frontend.png)

As can be seen in the above image, the UI is formatted to allow the user to specify their query in the top section, with their results displayed in the middle. From the top, specific genres can be selected using the dropdown, page numbers can be chosen using the inputs, and a total number of results can be chosen. In case the user selects a number of results larger than the front-end can display, a scroll bar will appear, allowing the user to scroll through the center element to view all of their results.
